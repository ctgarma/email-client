# email-client



An E-mail Client developed using Reactjs. It is used in tandem with my <a href="https://github.com/ctgarma/email-service">Email-services API</a>. It has react-bootstrap components for responsiveness features.

Clone or Download Repo and run:

<strong>npm install</strong>


To start the program run :

<strong>npm start</strong>

To start the test suite run:

<strong>npm test</strong>


The project is using an .env file that contains the appropriate URL for the Email-services API. Please modify it accordingly.



This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
